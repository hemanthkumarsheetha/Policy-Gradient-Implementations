# Policy Gradient Implementations

These Implementations include the following Algorithms:
1) Vanilla Policy Gradients with Baseline
2) Actor-Critic Policy Gradient
3) Proximal Policy Optimization 

All these Algorithms are trained using gym and mujoco environments like CartPole,FrozenLake,HalfCheetah etc
